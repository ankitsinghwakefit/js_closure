## Scope (Where to look for things)

1. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

console.log(window.firstName, window.lastName, window.knownAs); //----------- why undefined
undefined undefined no one
```

2. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(window.fullName(firstName, lastName));
Arya Stark
```

3. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var one = addOne(0);
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);
// 1 2
```


4. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);
// 1 2
```

5. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
// 1
// 2
```

6. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
// Cannot access 'addOne' before initialization as till time in execution context the initialization of const is not happen.
```

7. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
// Cannot access 'addOne' before initialization as till time in execution context the initialization of const is not happen.
```

8. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  var awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
// undefined 
```

9. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  console.log(awesome)
  if (true) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
// true 
```

10. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
// undefined 
```

11. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);
// AryaStark
```

12. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);
// AryaStark
```

13. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
function sayHello() {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
sayHello();

console.log(name);
// name is not defined, as let is block scope, outside function no name exists.
```

14. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  var name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);
// Arya Stark, as var is global scope decleration 
```

15. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);
// name is not defined as let exists only inside if block.
```

16. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);
// 20, as final value assign to i is 19 but with i++ i will be 20.
```

17. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);
// i is not defined, as let is block scope and is defined inside for block.
```

18. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 100);
}
console.log(i, "second");
// 20, second
// 20 first , any function inside setTimeout is executed after the execution of other code and once all code executed lastly setTimeout execute.
```

19. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 100);
}
console.log(i, "second");
// i is not defined
// 0 first , as i has only block level scope thus can be used only inside for block.
```

20. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}
// "John Snow" , var has global scope thus can be accessable any where once defined.
```

21. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}
// username is not defined, as let has block scope i.e. can be used only inside if block.
```

22. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  var username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username);
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}
// John Snow 
// John Snow, second  , as var username has global scope, and username is premitive thus pass by value works.
```

23. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  let username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username, "first");
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}
// John Snow first
// Arya Stark second , as username inside if statement has block scope thus it will not affect the outside username.
// John Snow first is printed as username is also present inside if block thus it will use local variable.
```

24. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    let message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}

sample("First", "Second", "Third");
//Hello I am First
//Hello I am Second
//Hello I am Third
```

25. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    const message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}

sample("First", "Second", "Third");
```

26. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
if (true) {
  const myFunc = function() {
    console.log(username, "Second");
  };
  console.log(username, "First");
  let username = "Hello World!";
  myFunc();
}
//Cannot access 'username' before initialization, as at this point of time inside execution context username is not initilized with any value, its just a box.
```

27. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    console.log("I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}");
  }
  inner();
}

outer();
//"I love this movie called MAD MAX: FURY ROAD" , as inner function has no variable defined called movie so it will search for parent scope and find movie and print.
```

28. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    console.log("I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}");
  }
  inner();
}

outer();
// "I love this movie called BEFORE SUNRISE" , as inner function will access to movie = "Before Sunrise" as present inside function.
```

29. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    function extraInner() {
      let movie = "Gone Girl";
      console.log("I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}");
    }
    extraInner();
  }
  inner();
}

outer();
// GONE GIRL  , as let has block scope so inside extraInner function movie is used. 
```

30. Execute all the functions inside `allFunctions` variable using any loop. (Hint: use for of loop functions are object)

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, sub, multiply, divide];

``
for(fun of allFunctions){
  var ab = fun(20,12);
  console.log(ab);
}

31. You have to pass 10 and 12 as initial value and find the final output when you pass the return value of one function as an input to the next function in the array `allFunctions`.

````js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, add, add, add, add, sub, sub, multiply, divide];
for(fun of allFunctions){
  var ab = fun(10,12);
  console.log(ab); ------------------------------- ask we get the 1 value after add what will be the other value..?
}
```
